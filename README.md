# Protocol Buffers

The project is a solution to the following task:

Describe the selected area of life (I used a collection of all grades of a student) in Protocol Buffers notation. Use the most appropriate types for each data. Create an object, fill it with sample data, serialize it to a file and read it back into memory making sure it hasn't changed.

Additionally: create classes for UDP Unicast communication to send messages serialized with the Protocol Buffers mechanism. Example: the sender in his message sends a query for all math grades for a given student, which the server sends back to the sender. The application can be very simple - it does not need to use a database, the answers can be random.
